I work with organization to support their learning journey. I am committed to supporting organizations in the development of robust Monitoring, Evaluation, and Learning (MEL) systems - including theories of change, learning agendas, and data collection, storage, and analysis systems. To complement these efforts, I assist in designing intuitive dashboards that facilitate real-time data visualization and analysis, empowering organizations to make informed decisions and demonstrate their impact to stakeholders.
