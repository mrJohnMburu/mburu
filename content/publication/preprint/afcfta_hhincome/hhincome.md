abstract: Despite efforts to increase household income in Kenya, 36 percent of Kenyans lived in poverty in 2022, while the median household income has been declining since 2005. Kenya also faces a persistent challenge with income inequality, with the bottom 50 percent of the population capturing only 14 percent of total income in 2019. Although previous studies have examined the potential welfare effects of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), only a few studies have specifically addressed its impact on Kenyaâ€™s household income. The AfCFTA presents a significant opportunity for Kenya by providing access to a vast market valued at $ 3.4 trillion. This study investigates the potential impact of AfCFTA on household income in Kenya. The study uses a modified Global Trade Analysis Project (MyGTAP) model, which disaggregates the single private household in the standard GTAP model into 22 private households for a more granular analysis. The households are disaggregated into two urban areas of Nairobi and Mombasa, and six Agricultural Ecological Zones (AEZs). The study shows that AfCFTA will have heterogeneous impact on household income. First, in Nairobi and Mombasa, higher-income households will benefit disproportionately more than lower-income households. Second, the household income of urban households in AEZs is projected to increase more than that of their rural counterparts. Lastly, some households, such as those in the arid south, are expected to experience a decline in income. Overall, these findings highlight the potential of AfCFTA to increase household income. However,  AfCFTA is likely to income inequality in urban areas and between rural and urban households. Targeted government support and income redistribution policies will be vital in mitigating potential increase in income inequality.
