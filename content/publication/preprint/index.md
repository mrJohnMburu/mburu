abstract: Gender inequality is one of the main challenges facing developing and developed countries, Kenya included. This is acknowledged by the development community, and it is anchored in goal five of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which aims at reducing poverty by promoting gender equality and empowering women. In Kenya, it has been acknowledged by the development of  guidelines on how to address gender inequality in Kenya’s Constitution, amendment of the two third gender rule bill of 2018 and establishment of semi-autonomous government agencies like Women Enterprise Fund (WEF). However, despite massive progress in education and economic policy, women tend to earn less compared to men for equal work. In Kenya, women earn less than their men counterparts with as much as 35 percent. Despite several studies, the extent and driver of the gender wage gap remains a contentious issue. The question being; whether the gender wage gap emanates from human capital and other factors being unequally distributed, or it is due to discrimination. The current study uses household survey data in 2005 and 2015 to investigate the extent and drivers of the gender wage gap in Kenya. The study utilized the recentered Influence Function (RIF) regression and an extension of the Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition method to estimate how changes in the distribution of human capital and institutional factors affect the gender wage gap. The study found that, between 2005 and 2015, the gender wage gap increased in Kenya. Moreover, discrimination seems to be the key driver of the gender wage gap at lower quantiles. In comparison, differences in employees’ characteristics are significant drivers of the gender wage gap in the upper(higher) quantiles. The study recommends a policies that increases human capital investment by women and wage transparency in Kenya.

abstract: Private investment is essential for job creation, technological upgrading, and economic growth. However, private investment has been low in Kenya, given its income level. This study estimated the effect of government domestic borrowing on private investment and the optimal level of government domestic borrowing in Kenya. The study used time series data between 1980 and 2019 and a modified regression model. We found that annual government domestic borrowing has a positive and statistically significant effect on private investment. In contrast, the square of annual government domestic borrowing has a negative and statistically significant effect on private investment. Hence, annual government domestic borrowing crowds in private investment at lower levels but crowds out private investment at higher levels. We also found that the optimal level of annual government domestic borrowing as a percentage of GDP in Kenya during the study period was 3.84 percent. The study findings suggest that a policy that aims to ensure optimal private investment should maintain annual government domestic borrowing as a percentage of GDP at around 3.84 percent.
