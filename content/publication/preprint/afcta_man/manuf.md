abstract: The manufacturing sector plays a crucial role in economic development due to its high productivity, rapid growth rate, capacity to absorb low-skilled labor, and production of exportable goods. As a results, policies such as Kenya Vision 2030, the Big Four Agenda, the Integrated National Export Development and Promotion Strategy, and the National Industrialization Policy Framework have been developed to strengthen this sector in Kenya. Despite these efforts, growth, employment, GDP contribution, and productivity in Kenya’s manufacturing sector remain low. There is a significant opportunity for improvement through regional trade agreements, most notably the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA). The AfCFTA creates a unified liberalized market across 54 African countries with a GDP of USD 3.4 trillion and a population of 1.5 billion. This study examines the potential impact of AfCFTA on Kenya’s manufacturing output, employment, and productivity using the heterogeneous firm GTAP model. Findings indicate that AfCFTA will increase overall manufacturing output and employment in Kenya. However, the impact varies widely at the sectoral level – while output and employment will increase in the rubber and plastics subsector, they will decline in food, beverages, and tobacco. Additionally, average productivity in the rubber and plastics subsector will increase, but decline in textile, apparel, and leather, and wood, paper, and printing subsectors. Hence, government support will be crucial for both expanding and declining subsectors to enable firms to adapt and mitigate output and job losses.
