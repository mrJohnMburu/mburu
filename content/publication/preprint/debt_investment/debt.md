abstract: Private investment is essential for job creation, technological upgrading, and economic growth. However, private investment has been low in Kenya, given its income level. This study estimated the effect of government domestic borrowing on private investment and the optimal level of government domestic borrowing in Kenya. The study used time series data between 1980 and 2019 and a modified regression model. We found that annual government domestic borrowing has a positive and statistically significant effect on private investment. In contrast, the square of annual government domestic borrowing has a negative and statistically significant effect on private investment. Hence, annual government domestic borrowing crowds in private investment at lower levels but crowds out private investment at higher levels. We also found that the optimal level of annual government domestic borrowing as a percentage of GDP in Kenya during the study period was 3.84 percent. The study findings suggest that a policy that aims to ensure optimal private investment should maintain annual government domestic borrowing as a percentage of GDP at around 3.84 percent.
