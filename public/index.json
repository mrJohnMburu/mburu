However, private investment has been low in Kenya, given its income level. This study estimated the effect of government domestic borrowing on private investment and the optimal level of government domestic borrowing in Kenya. The study used time series data between 1980 and 2019 and a modified regression model. We found that annual government domestic borrowing has a positive and statistically significant effect on private investment. In contrast, the square of annual government domestic borrowing has a negative and statistically significant effect on private investment. Hence, annual government domestic borrowing crowds in private investment at lower levels but crowds out private investment at higher levels. We also found that the optimal level of annual government domestic borrowing as a percentage of GDP in Kenya during the study period was 3.84 percent. The study findings suggest that a policy that aims to ensure optimal private investment should maintain annual government domestic borrowing as a percentage of GDP at around 3.84 percent.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Does government domestic borrowing crowd in or crowd out private investment in Kenya?","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Introduction Econometrics is a social science that applies the tools of economic theory, mathematics, and statistical inference to analyze economic data and explore causal relationships (Greene 2014). Hence, econometrics uses economic theory to make credible claim about human behavior, formulate the claim into mathematical equations and use statistical inference to measure whether the claim is statistically significance. For example, an economist may be interested to know whether the social programs like cash transfer program instituted by Kenya government during the Covid-19 pandemic cushioned family from the negative effect of the pandemic. The economist may claim that the cash transfer led to increase in household consumption. This is Keynesian theory of consumption. The economic theory helps the economist to formulate a hypothesis i.e. increase in income leads to increase in consumption. The hypothesis can either be true or false, and hence, the economist needs to test whether there is any relationship between income and consumption. There is a need to express the relationship in a mathematical form. Let assumes that income and consumption has a linear relationship i.e.\n(1).$ y_i = \\alpha + \\beta x_i $\nIn equation (1) $ y_i $ is consumption of individual $ i $ and $ x_i $ is the income and $ \\alpha $ and $ \\beta $ are parameters. Our interest is to know whether $ \\beta $ is positive or not. Another restriction from Keynesian theory of consumption is that $ 0 \u0026lt; \\beta \u0026lt; 1 $.\nEquation (1) above assumes that only income affect consumption and there is one-to-one relationship between income and consumption. However, in most economic applications the researcher is not able to observe all variables that can affect a $ y_i $. Moreover, it is likely that the relationship between consumption and income is not perfect. Hence, we add an error term, that capture any other variable not included in the model, any specification errors and measurement errors.\n(2).$ y_i = \\alpha + \\beta x_i + e_i $\nDifferent approach can be used to estimate the value $ \\beta $. This includes:\n Ordinary Least Square Maximum Likelihood Estimation Method of Moments  Review of Ordinary Least square (OLS) Since $ e_i $ is unobservable, we need to make several assumptions to be estimate the value of $ \\beta $.\nAsumption of OLS  Linearity- $ y_i = \\alpha + \\beta x_i + e_i $ $ E(e_i) = 0 $ $ var(e_i) = \\sigma^2 $ $ E(e_i,e_j) = 0 $ $ E(x_i,e_i) = 0 $ No multicollinearity $ x_i $ is fixed in repeated samples $ e_i \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2) $ No outliers  Estimation The least square principle asserts that we can fit a line of best fit through the data by minimizing the sum of squared errors. Let us stack the $ y_i $ observations into a matrix $ Y $, $ x_i $ observations into matrix of $ X $, and $ e_i $ values into matrix of $ e $. Hence, equation (2) can be written in matrix form as:\n(3).$ Y = X \\beta + e $\nwhere $ Y $ is $ N x 1 $ vector of dependent variable, $ X $ is $ N x K $ matrix of independent variables, $ e $ is $ N x 1 $ vector of errors, and $ \\beta $ is a $ Kx1 $ vector of parameters to be estimated.\nEquation (3) can be expressed as;\n(4).$ e = Y-X \\beta $\nThe aim is to minimize the sum of squared residuals.\n(5).min $ e’e = (Y-X \\beta)’(Y-X \\beta) $\nMinimizing the sum of squared residuals, we get:\n(6).$ \\hat \\beta = (X’X)^{-1}X’Y $\nIllustration Let us use simulation to illustration linear regression in R.I simulate data x and Y, and assume the value of $ \\beta $ is 2 and the value of $ \\alpha $ is 40. The number of observation is 100. I assume x is normally distributed with a mean of 30 and a standard deviation of 10 while error terms are normally distributed with a mean of zero and a standard deviation of 4.\nset.seed(1)\r#Simulate 100 observations with mean of 30 and standard deviation of 10.\rx \u0026lt;- rnorm(100, 30, 10)\r#Simulate 100 observations with a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 4.\re \u0026lt;- rnorm(100, 0, 4)\r# Generate y as a linear function of x and e.\ry \u0026lt;- 40 + 2*x + e\r# use lm() function, to run a linear regression\rprint(lm(y ~ x))\r ## ## Call:\r## lm(formula = y ~ x)\r## ## Coefficients:\r## (Intercept) x ## 39.86 2.00\r As the output shows, the value of coefficient of $ x $ is 2 while the intercept is approximately 40.\nWhat if were to use equation (6), what will we get? I start with an illustration to show how data used for regression is usually arranged. You have N individual, in our case N = 100. Each individual has a linear equation linking y and x. Hence, the vector of Y is a column vector of dependent variable and X is N by K matrix of independent variable. Where K is the number of independent variables. The first column of X is filled with 1’s as it corresponds to the intercept. The table below illustrates the data structure. You read x1,1 as “first independent variable for the first individual” and so on. x1 is the variable for the intercept, and it is equal to 1 while y and x2 has been generated above.\n   Y X1 X2     y1 x1,1 x2,1   y2 x1,2 x2,2   . . .   . . .   . . .   y100 X1,100 x2,100    Let us start by generating x1 is a vector of 1’s with a length of 100, and use equation (6) to calculate the value $ \\beta $.\n#create a sequence of 1.\rA \u0026lt;- seq(from =1, to = 1, length.out = 100)\r#convert the x and y into matrices.\r#The x and y generated above, contains the 100 values of each variables.

This is acknowledged by the development community, and it is anchored in goal five of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which aims at reducing poverty by promoting gender equality and empowering women. In Kenya, it has been acknowledged by the development of  guidelines on how to address gender inequality in Kenya’s Constitution, amendment of the two third gender rule bill of 2018 and establishment of semi-autonomous government agencies like Women Enterprise Fund (WEF). However, despite massive progress in education and economic policy, women tend to earn less compared to men for equal work. In Kenya, women earn less than their men counterparts with as much as 35 percent. Despite several studies, the extent and driver of the gender wage gap remains a contentious issue. The question being; whether the gender wage gap emanates from human capital and other factors being unequally distributed, or it is due to discrimination. The current study uses household survey data in 2005 and 2015 to investigate the extent and drivers of the gender wage gap in Kenya. The study utilized the recentered Influence Function (RIF) regression and an extension of the Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition method to estimate how changes in the distribution of human capital and institutional factors affect the gender wage gap. The study found that, between 2005 and 2015, the gender wage gap increased in Kenya. Moreover, discrimination seems to be the key driver of the gender wage gap at lower quantiles. In comparison, differences in employees’ characteristics are significant drivers of the gender wage gap in the upper(higher) quantiles. The study recommends a policies that increases human capital investment by women and wage transparency in Kenya.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Gender wage gap in Kenya Extent and Explanation","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\n Features  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides   Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E   Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;\rif porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;:\rprint(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)\r  Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\n Fragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}}\r{{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}}\r{{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}\r Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three \n A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears   Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}}\r- Only the speaker can read these notes\r- Press `S` key to view\r{{% /speaker_note %}}\r Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view    Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links    night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links   Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/media/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}\r{{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}\r{{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}\r  Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1,\r.reveal section h2,\r.reveal section h3 {\rcolor: navy;\r}\r  Questions?
